You could watch reset Statement in 1.v code.

Value of B depends on reset Statement in Commenting out area. but we don't need set Value of B at reset high.

Because B will be setted when en signal turn to high.

6-input LUT occupies area more then 5-input LUT. The more inputs are added, the more area it takes up!

That is why B don't initialize at reset Statement.
